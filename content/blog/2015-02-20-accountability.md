<em>"What? Now?"</em>  
"I have to. I told them I would or I would give them each $25."  
<em>"So, you're telling me they're both doing this as well?"</em>  
"No, just me. It was my way of making sure I'll do it."  
<em>"... Why do you have to do such things?"</em>

So went the conversation between Arshdeep Kaur and me before I went out for a 7K run after not having run since last year's 10K Sun Run, about which <a title="How I Rocked the Sun Run With No Training" href="http://www.vegansikhgeek.com/how-i-rocked-the-sun-run-with-no-training/">I wrote</a> and the lesson from which I obviously forgot. A week before the conversation above, I had sent a message to my brother and cousin in our fitness group in WhatsApp and said that I would run a total of 7K by the end of the week or would owe them each $25. This, I felt, would mean doing 1K each day and get a good habit going. Instead of kicking into gear, though, I kicked into procrastination mode and blamed a busy schedule and rain for being unable to go each day. Before I knew it, 9pm on Saturday night was upon me and I found myself having the conversation above with my wife. I still had other things to do and it was still raining, but I didn't want to report the next day that I had done zero, nor did I want to be out $50 for a reason that I could have prevented. I set RunKeeper to my custom 3 Minute On, 1 Minute Off workout setting, hit play on one of my favourite podcasts on Stitcher and set off.

The first 2K passed with a whirlwind of thoughts: "That's 1K. You would have been done now if this was 6 days ago." "Maybe my ankle will start hurting like it did during the Sun Run and I can tell them that I had to stop because of an injury." "Hey, I'm actually enjoying this." Kilometres 3 and 4 were agonizing because I looked at my phone frequently to check distance and pace. When I stopped doing that, I honestly couldn't tell you where the next 2.5K went. I don't know if I zen'd out or passed out and somebody carried me, but what snapped me back to consciousness was the alert that the total distance was 6.5K. Energy rushed into my legs and I finished feeling better than I could have imagined.

Had I told only myself a week earlier that I was going to run 7K total that week and found myself on Saturday night with the full 7 still to go, I would easily have told myself that I could set the new goal to the following week, when the weather would probably be nicer as well. Because I had two people who were going to hold me accountable, however, there was motivation to complete the goal.

That accountability can be key for building new habits. I had a similar deal with a sister of mine who would hold me accountable when I went off Facebook for a month in December. While the urges weren't as strong to check it as I thought they might be when I started, any time I did think to take a peek at the News Feed in a moment of temporary silence made me think about whether it would be worth the $50 it would cost. As a result of that month, I'm not tied to social networks as I used to be.

With this blog, I announced it to many people. I sent out texts, put up <a href="https://www.facebook.com/navdeepsingh/posts/10152553457876207" target="_blank">a status</a> on Facebook, <a href="https://twitter.com/navdeepsingh/status/566470459206533125" target="_blank">Tweeted it</a> and invited friends to Like the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vegansikhgeek" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>. I wanted everyone to hold me accountable. Even though I enjoy writing, there will be times in the future when I'll want to check my RSS feeds instead, or let other tasks push it down in priority. I know what will pop back up in my head will be my word that I gave to many and I'll get to writing, lest someone ask me one day how the blogging is going and I say, "Ah, yeah. Well, I never did really get around to it."

So, if you want to build a habit, try something new, or kick a bad habit, tell others. Make it known what you want to do, what the consequences will be if you don't do it, and be held accountable.
