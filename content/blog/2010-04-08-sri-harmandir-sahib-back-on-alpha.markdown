This morning, I came downstairs after getting ready for work and heard the TV and knew, as usual, my grandmother was watching the morning broadcast on Alpha Punjabi (Shaw Cable - 189). I could tell it was different from the sound, but it was familiar all the same. "Bolauuuuu Jeeee" came the voice of the Ardaas Saevaadaar and my heart leaped: It was coming from Sri Harmandir Sahib. I entered the family room and it was confirmed. I quickly snapped a photo because, of course, I was going to <a href="http://twitter.com/navdeepsingh/status/11825583215" target="_blank">Tweet it</a> and left for work. I wondered if it was an old recording, as my grandmother suspected, or if Alpha came to their senses and started to give the paying customers what they wanted back. I called home to ask what the Hukamnama was, but my grandmother had missed it.

Ah well. Perhaps someone who caught it could compare with today's Hukamnaamaa on <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/hukam" target="_blank">SikhNet</a> and see. Otherwise, we'll see tomorrow, Insha'Allah.
