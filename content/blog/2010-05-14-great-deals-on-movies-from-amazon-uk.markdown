So, I follow <a href="http://twitter.com/dealsplus" target="_blank">@dealsplus</a> on Twitter and they find some really good things. They had a link to The Matrix Trilogy on Blu-ray for &pound;11 or so at <a href="http://amazon.co.uk" target="_blank">Amazon UK</a>. I checked the US and Canada sites and it was over $35 US and about $100 CA respectively. Craziness, innit? I got that trilogy early this year and looked for some others recently and got the Bourne trilogy for &pound;17 and Pirates trilogy for &pound;25. Shipping costs are &pound;3-&pound;4, which is very little, but just know that it might take 3-4 weeks to get to Canada. <em>[Update: Scratch that. Pirates came in 7 days!]</em> I did mention that these are all on Blu-ray, right? In case you're wondering, no issues with PAL vs NTSC, but don't hold me accountable if you buy a DVD and it doesn't work for you.

Try comparing prices and you might find some great deals. Enjoy!
