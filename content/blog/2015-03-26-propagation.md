It matters not whether your meditation is conversation, contemplation, supplication or iteration; whether in congregation or isolation. If it's with adoration, your love has my admiration.

Your dedication to the regulation of your education is a source of inspiration but, if you're using your concentration in the circulation of information with no verification, I need not your relation in my greatest desperation.

It's your choice. Your communication, depending on articulation, may be a source of motivation and cause some ambulation for a short duration, or desolation to the population in observation of your profanation.

Lead with affirmation; not negation.
