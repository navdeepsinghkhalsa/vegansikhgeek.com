I'd like to take a page out of the book of one of my favourite writers, Joshua Becker of <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/" target="_blank">Becoming Minimalist</a>. Each weekend, I'd like to give you some insight into what I've been reading, doing, or trying. Topics will commonly fall into the categories about which I blog: minimalism, life, veganism, and even tech (I am the Vegan Sikh Geek after all!)

Prepare a cup or mug of your favourite warm beverage and have a read and listen. Peace and blessings

The pumpkin taste was subtle, so you may want to put in a bit more than the 3/4 cup if you want it to be more festive. :)

Aad Guray Nameh by Snatam Kaur - My wife and I owe so much to this blessed soul.
