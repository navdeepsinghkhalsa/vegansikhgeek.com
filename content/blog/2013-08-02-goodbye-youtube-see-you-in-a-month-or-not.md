I'm following in the footsteps of Leo Babauta and his <a href="http://zenhabits.net/without/" target="_blank">A Year of Living Without</a> experiment.

YouTube is fantastic. It serves as a form of education and entertainment. There is much one can learn and experience but only slightly less that one would wish they could un-watch. While I've learned much about many subjects on YouTube, after following related link after link I sometimes find myself in what's commonly referred to as "that part of YouTube" where senselessness is the topic and time-wasting is the consequence.

As the experiment goes, I will abstain from the habit of visiting YouTube.com for a whole month and then decide if it was worth it. I can completely give it up, go back to as I used it before, or whatever in between. Whatever the case, I'll be in a good position to adapt to whichever habit I'd like to adopt after a month away from it.

My replacement good habit will be to listen to audio podcasts. These will serve as the replacement content that I would normally seek out by searching on YouTube. I hope to learn new things without getting distracted by video content and media unrelated to anything pertinent. So, goodbye to searches for Richard Dawkins, James Randi, Zakir Naik, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Everything Wrong With X-Men in 6 Minutes, Seinfeld Bloopers, Things Muslims Say In Ramadan, Goodbye Remix, Honest Trailers, Top 11 Most Awesome Movie Themes, All Courtroom Scenes From A Few Good Men, and Five Stupid Things About Holocaust Denial.
