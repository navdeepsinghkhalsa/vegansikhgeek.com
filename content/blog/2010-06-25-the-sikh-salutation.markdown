<em>The following is my opinion, just like almost everything on this blog. Please don't judge Sikhi based on my opinions.</em>

Vaahiguroo Jee Kaa Khaalsaa, Vaahiguroo Jee Kee Fateh

Did you read that statement? I mean, <em>actually</em> read it, or did you just recognize the words and automatically "know" what it said? Perhaps when you say it, it sounds like "Wah-girj Khalsa, Wah-girj Fateh" or "Why Khalsa, Why Fateh". I'm not judging you based on how you say it, but check thisâ€¦ I tried something some time ago: You know how when you're trying to get your prayers done for the sake of doing them, you don't really think about what you're saying, but when you slow down and really read them, all these motivating feelings come about? I tried it when greeting Sikhs with "Vaahiguroo Jee Kaa Khaalsaa, Vaahiguroo Jee Kee Fateh" and it was awesome. Similar feelings came about, and a sense of contentment took over if there was anything but that.

The Fateh is beyond worldly feelings. It doesn't matter if I don't like you as a person, when we share this greeting, we recognize that Khalsa is God's, and so is victory. If God claims victory, how can there be ill feelings while making this statement? I should be thinking "<a title="Come, join with me, O Sikh of the Guru, come and join with me. You are my Guru's Beloved. " href="http://sikhitothemax.com/page.asp?ShabadID=2776" target="_blank">Aae Mil Gurasikh Aae Mil Thoo Maerae Guroo Kae Piaarae</a>", not "Punk, get away from me". Slowly (or possibly quickly), the feeling may extend past the greeting and make its way into the conversation, and then into the way you feel about the person altogether.
