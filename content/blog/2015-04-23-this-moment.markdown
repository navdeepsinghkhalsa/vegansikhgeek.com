<p>This moment is unique. Never again will it come to pass. It can't be relived, nor can it be duplicated.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that opportunities will not come again. If my choice's outcome wasn't "favourable," it will not have been a waste if I learned something from it. I can't be so attached to a previous moment that I don't recognize that a new one is upon me.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I'm too into a moment and forget the larger picture. If I'm not careful, the moment can be all-consuming and I could make a choice that might hurt me or someone else. If I take a step back and recognize that this is but a moment in a lifetime of moments, perhaps I can choose more wisely and enjoy a better outcome.</p>
<p>Too often, I don't recognize that any given moment could be my last. It's not such a barbaric or hopeless thing to think. Such acceptance would increase the value of each moment.</p>
<p>Moments may come and they will go. Time, alas, waits for no one. How will I choose to live this moment?</p>
