The following is a dramatized conversation I had with myself recently in letting go of a relationship.

"You need to move on. This has gone on long enough."

<em>"I can cope!"</em>

"The negatives far outweigh the positives. Just let go."

<em>"But just look at the positives!"</em>

"The cold and bitterness is getting to be too much."

<em>"I can tough it out. Things will warm up!"</em>

"This is starting to affect you physically!"

<em>"What? I feel fine!"</em>

"Look. Your skin is drying up."

<em>"I'll moisturize!"</em>

"Nonsense. You don't have the discipline."

<em>"How can I let go after having personal interaction on a daily basis for so long?"</em>

"You can still have that. Just wait until the bitterness ends. Maybe you can have the weekends together?"

<em>"Hmm."</em>

"Just keep things casual. No commitments for a while."

<em>"I… maybe I can do that."</em>

"Yeah?"

<em>"… Yeah."</em>

"So, you'll lose the sandals and start wearing shoes?"

<em>"… I… Yes."</em>
