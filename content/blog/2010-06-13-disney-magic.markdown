Arshdeep Kaur and I just got back from a vacation to California a few days ago. We spent 3 days at Disneyland/California Adventures and a day at Universal Studios. We'd meant to spend a day at Six Flags Magic Mountain, but will talk about the vacation itself in another (probably longer) post, Insha'Allah.

<strong>Disney &amp; Mickey</strong>

Straight out, Disney is magic. It may not be as happy a place as a spiritual group meditation, but Disneyland's slogan of The Happiest Place on Earth is the truth for many visitors, I'm sure. It's interesting that the same creature that is such a feared critter is responsible for so many beautiful smiles, laughs and memories. When Mickey Mouse pops up during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasmic!" target="_blank">Fantasmic!</a>, the nighttime show, it really warms the heart. I'm getting all sappy and corny, I know, but it's all true. We don't see much of Mickey in movies or cartoons these days but, at the park, we couldn't look in any direction without seeing Mickey hats. It doesn't matter how many new characters come out, how much cooler or hip they may be, the legend lives on. Look at the comic <a href="http://comics.com/get_fuzzy/" target="_blank">Get Fuzzy</a>: a rude cat, a foolish dog, and a geeky owner, just like Garfield but newer, but Garfield will always be remembered as the comic strip featuring a cat.

<strong>Disneyland</strong>

There's even a sign stating it. There is so much attention to detail and brilliant use of space, it's amazing. Just looking at some of the buildings, we didn't imagine there would be as much inside as there was. They reminded me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Mr._Weasley.27s_car" target="_blank">Arthur Weasley's Ford Anglia</a>. Cast members (employees) all have different uniforms, specific to the ride/park area they work in. The greenery, building texture, and even ground are all different depending on the ride/park area. Sure, there aren't as many thrilling rides as other theme parks, but I don't think this one can be matched for the magical atmosphere. There's so much to do in the park, and there's no question that it's pricey, but it's just great. Alright, I think I'm sounding repetitive now.

If I was popular enough, I'd probably get many comments about how the Disney corporation is evil and what it has done/is doing to make many peoples' lives difficult, but that's not what this post is about. I don't discourage the comments, though. Any comments are welcome.

That's all I really wanted to say. Again, this post wasn't about the vacation. I'll talk about being vegan/vegetarian, the rides, and different parks in another post, Insha'Allah.
