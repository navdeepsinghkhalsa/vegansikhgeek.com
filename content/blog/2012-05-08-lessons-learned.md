There is much to learn about one's own practices from those who are further along in their related practices. Bhai (Brother) Parminder Singh shared his knowledge, interpretations and feelings about Sikh history, philosophy and scripture. Bhai Charanjit Singh shared his knowledge of Sikh history and martial arts. BhainJee (Sister) Rena Kaur shared her knowledge of Punjabi and beautifully sang hymns.

Even if they hypothetically weren't further along in those things, they were still people and there is much to learn for one's own character simply by recognizing humanity.

The person who was Bhai Parminder Singh was humble, but powerful. A small interaction with him opened my eyes to how I needed to check out my ego.

The person who was Bhai Charanjit Singh was very adaptive to environments. A small interaction with him taught me about patience.

The person who was BhainJee Rena Kaur was strong-willed. A small interaction with her taught me about perseverance.

There is much to learn from others, no matter who they are. There is much to learn about one's own self by exploring the unknown. There is much to learn about learning. There is much to learn.
