<blockquote>When doing meditation, is it ok to start with a guided meditation audio to transcend to a deeper state of mind and then start simran of gurmantar? Sometimes it is hard for me to really get focused especially if I am meditating alone rather than in congregation.</blockquote>

If it's helping you with your inner peace, that's great! There's no question, just do it. :) Learn from it. Know what it is about the meditation and each step which get you to the state so you can recreate it/them in your mind to get to that state at will.

I would love to also try it. Would you please let me know which one you use?
