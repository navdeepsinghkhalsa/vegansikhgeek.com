I'm not scared of death. I'm not afraid to leave anyone or anything behind.

I believe in Karma and reincarnation, and while I know I haven't done enough to break the cycle, I am prepared to humbly accept my next station.

What I mean, though, when I say that I'm not prepared is that I am leaving a mess for others to clean up. There is no mortgage insurance on my house, there are online accounts and subscriptions that my wife would have to figure out, miscellaneous things in boxes that I haven't filed or discarded, passwords that only I know, processes at Khalis that only I know.

My dad taught me that no matter the person, the world keeps spinning on everyone's departure from it. I trust that, were I to depart at any time, everyone could figure things out. However, I do them a disservice by not documenting and organizing now.

This year, I've been making a concentrated effort to resolve this issue.
