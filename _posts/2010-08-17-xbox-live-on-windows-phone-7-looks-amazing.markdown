<p>Holy moly crocodoly! Some weight has just been added to Windows Phone on the four-way scale that will be determining which platform/phone I adopt <a href="http://navdeepsingh.ca/2010/07/phone-outlook/" target="_blank">when I switch</a>. Xbox Live for Windows Phone 7 has been shown off to Engadget and it looks spectacular. Now, I'm not a gamer - my Nintendo Wii has been collecting dust for some time now - but I can appreciate that there's some solid architecture and hardware that's running this thing. Just seeing the videos and reading about it got me excited enough about gaming to visit xbox.com and make sure that I have a profile.</p>
