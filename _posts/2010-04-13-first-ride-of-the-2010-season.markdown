<p>Arshdeep Kaur and I got out for our first bike ride of the season yesterday and it was awesome. We took it nice and easy and enjoyed Rehraas Saahib while staying within a few blocks' radius. I was on my <a href="http://norco.com/bikes/urban/cruisers/santiago/" target="_blank">Norco Santiago</a> and she was on Inderpreet Kaur's old Huffy, and it was easy to tell that the cruiser was better for the ride than a mountain bike. As the days get warmer and we get into better shape, it'll be nice to go for longer/farther/harder rides, but we'll have to wait until we get bikes built for that kind of riding.</p>
<p>I realize now that I only became more familiar with Burnaby while growing up because of bike rides. <a href="http://pardeepsingh.ca" target="_blank">My brother</a>, Gurpreet (cousin) and I used to just hop on our bikes and go exploring, to find the biggest hill we could so we could fly down it. The memories came rushing back when I got onto that bike and we coasted off.</p>
