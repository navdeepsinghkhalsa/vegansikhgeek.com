<p>I've heard some people say that 3D is the next Blu-ray, but that doesn't make sense. It's not a media, it's a way to view movies/television shows, like Standard Definition (SD) and High Definition (HD). Not everyone is on HD yet, and already we're being told to upgrade to 3D-ready televisions. The difference between upgrading from SD -> HD and HD -> 3D is obviously the glasses. Are we ready to don the specs every time we turn on the TV? Will we need to send out a reminder to our buddies to remember their 3D glasses when they come over to watch the big game or fight? Big stores like Best Buy are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6295K820100311" target="_blank">throwing some weight</a> into selling these, so they must see some potential, but I wonder if 3D will catch on outside of the theatres.</p>
<p>Arshdeep Kaur and I went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892769/" target="_blank">How to Train Your Dragon</a> in 3D the other day and it's a more subtle 3D experience than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/" target="_blank">Avatar</a> and much more subtle than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1067106/" target="_blank">A Christmas Carol</a>, which I thought was a good thing. I like going for the 3D experience but not every 3D movie has to have an in-your-face, reach-out-and-touch experience and, as long as we're not paying much more for it, we'll keep choosing the 3D versions at the theatre.</p>
