<p>The following is a dramatized conversation I had with myself recently in letting go of a relationship.</p>
<p>"You need to move on. This has gone on long enough."</p>
<p><em>"I can cope!"</em></p>
<p>"The negatives far outweigh the positives. Just let go."</p>
<p><em>"But just look at the positives!"</em></p>
<p>"The cold and bitterness is getting to be too much."</p>
<p><em>"I can tough it out. Things will warm up!"</em></p>
<p>"This is starting to affect you physically!"</p>
<p><em>"What? I feel fine!"</em></p>
<p>"Look. Your skin is drying up."</p>
<p><em>"I'll moisturize!"</em></p>
<p>"Nonsense. You don't have the discipline."</p>
<p><em>"How can I let go after having personal interaction on a daily basis for so long?"</em></p>
<p>"You can still have that. Just wait until the bitterness ends. Maybe you can have the weekends together?"</p>
<p><em>"Hmm."</em></p>
<p>"Just keep things casual. No commitments for a while."</p>
<p><em>"I… maybe I can do that."</em></p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p><em>"… Yeah."</em></p>
<p>"So, you'll lose the sandals and start wearing shoes?"</p>
<p><em>"… I… Yes."</em></p>
