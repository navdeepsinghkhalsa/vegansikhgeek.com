<p>Why is there a market for gossip magazines, TMZ, dirt rags, etc? Are we so unfulfilled with our own lives that we need to look to into the private lives of celebrities to see their business and pitfalls? Look at the magazines by the cashier when you're in the line-up at the store, and all you see are headlines of celebrities losing/gaining weight, looking pregnant, being with other celebrities, getting drunk, getting arrested, etc. This happens every single day to everyday people, so why is it important if it happens to someone who chooses to make a living by acting or was born in to a monarchy?</p>
<p>It's all a play on our emotions and it only affects us negatively. When we see something positive, again it's like the quote I came across <a href="http://www.vegansikhgeek.com/post/29830574860/the-reason-we-struggle-with-insecurity-is-because" target="_blank">a few days ago</a>: "The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone else's highlight reel. -Steve Furtick" We get insecure about our own life and wish there was more to it. When there's something negative, it affects our ego and we smirk at how silly the person is to have let that happen. "Surely I would never be dumb enough to do that." It's a roller coaster for the ego and doesn't allow us to progress spiritually.</p>
<p>And how fair is it to those people whose photos are being taken? Some are unable to even get grocery without a camera in their face. We need to look closer to home to find our fulfillment in life. We need to live and let live.</p>
