<p>I was admiring the bruises which I receive weekly at a tactical knife training class and noticed how much they change over time. Inspiration struck and I came up with a book title. Naturally, I happen to think it's quite good. It's free for the taking by anyone who is in the business of giving and receiving pain. That could be MMA fighters, pro wrestlers, American football players, wrestlers, etc.</p>
<p>Alright, enough with the build-up, though it's not nearly over-hyped. Here is the title.</p>
<p>Fifty Shades of Purple</p>
<p>A thank-you on the dedication page and a signed copy should suffice. You're welcome.</p>
