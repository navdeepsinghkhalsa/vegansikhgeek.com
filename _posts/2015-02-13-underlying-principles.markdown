<p><em>Who cares how much scripture you have memorized?</em></p>
<p><em>Who cares if you have been initiated into a religion?</em></p>
<p><em>Who cares how you arrange your articles of faith?</em></p>
<p><em>Who cares how many debates you've won?</em></p>
<p><em>Who cares how many rallies you've attended?</em></p>
<p><em>We may boast about these things, but what's the use if there's no love?</em></p>
<p>Sometimes in observance of an ideology, we get too attached to the actions associated with it and forget the underlying principles. If love and compassion for self, others, and all living beings isn't increasing, we should re-evaluate how well we understand the groundwork laid before us.</p>
