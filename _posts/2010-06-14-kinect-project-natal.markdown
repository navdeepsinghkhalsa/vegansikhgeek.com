<p>Omigawd, omigawd, omigawd! This is awesome! Project Natal is now Kinect and it looks magnificent. I watched the live broadcast from E3 this morning and was blown away by how fluid and natural everything is. Don't know what I'm talking about? It's about Xbox. It's a controller, sort of. Simply put, it's an advanced camera system that lets YOU be the controller. Playing a racing game? Put your hands out like you're driving. Want to make your character jump? Jump. Want to pause the movie you're watching? Tell it to pause.</p>
<p>The Wii changed the way we play games, and Kinect is doing it again, but in an even more profound way and with more than just games. Movies, music, games, chat, the list goes on. Talk to <a href="http://twitter.com/preetsmangat" target="_blank">Preet Singh</a> if you want to know more.</p>
<p>The new Xbox 360 looks nuts, too. I have a Wii that's collecting dust, with an ever-growing list of things I should do rather than game, but I want, I want, I want!</p>
