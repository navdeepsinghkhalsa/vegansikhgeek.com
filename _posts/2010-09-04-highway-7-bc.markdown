<p>A post about a road? Yes. That's how awesome it is. It's not just any road; it's <a href="http://www.scenic7bc.com/" target="_blank">Highway 7</a>, BC. Definitely take this road if you're planning a trip to Harrisson Hot Springs or Hope.</p>
<p>Because I work so close to Lougheed Highway, I decided to take that to <a href="http://www.singhscamp.com/" target="_blank">Singhs Camp</a>, which was in Hope, after work on Wednesday rather than endure the rush-hour traffic on the Port Mann Bridge. I couldn't be happier with the decision. This was one of the most peaceful and beautiful drives I've ever had. I couldn't stop marvelling at the beauty of the scenery and cities I passed. From quaint houses to expansive farms to epic mountains, it was all greatness. I envied those who went about their lives on their farms, tending to their horses or cows, or just sitting outside on their patio. What a place to live!</p>
<p>I wonder if they get high-speed Internet accessâ€¦</p>
