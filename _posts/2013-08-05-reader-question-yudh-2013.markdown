<blockquote>Paaji, are you coming to Yudh 2013? I've seen you play gatka at some nagar kirtans. You should come. I'll battle you. (as in a friendly younger brother type of way bro)</blockquote>
<p>Brother, it would be nice to come, but I'm currently in a position where travelling abroad isn't possible. If you've seen me play, while I've been blessed with opportunities to learn from great Ustaads, you'll have noticed that I am poorly suited for competition anyway. I wish you all the best and trust that you'll have a fantastic time and learn loads. Akaal Sahaai.</p>
