<p>The weekend exhausted me. The <a href="http://www.bclocalnews.com/fraser_valley/abbynews/news/102261134.html" target="_blank">Abbotsford Nagar Keertan</a>, <a href="http://www.gurunanakgurdwara.ca/2010/events/yudh-2010-at-gnsg" target="_blank">Yudh</a>, and the launch of <a href="http://www.norco.com" target="_blank">Norco.com 2011</a> were reason for not much eating and even less sleep. Anyhow, I awoke very late today and was late for work. I normally start at 7:30, and so traffic doesn't affect me much and school zones aren't in effect, but I was leaving the house after 8:30 and pass two schools on the way. There I saw them&hellip; children, young adults&hellip; walking to school. Memories came flooding back of so many lessons, adventures, hardships and laughs that came from the elementary and secondary school days. Great, great times.</p>
<p>Many well-wishes to all who are embarking on a new journey. Cherish the times/moments and remember them. You'll wish you could go back.</p>
