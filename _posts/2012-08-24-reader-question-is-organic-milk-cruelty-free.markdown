<blockquote>Is organic milk cruelty free?</blockquote>
<p>It can be, though not necessarily. Dairy being organic and dairy being cruelty-free are exclusive from one another. It can be cruelty-free but not organic, and organic but not cruelty-free. It could be both and it could be neither. I would define dairy as being cruelty-free if it met the following criteria at minimum:</p>
<p>-Calves are not taken away from their mother<br />
-Bull calves are not discarded<br />
-Calves are not sold for veal<br />
-Cows are not contained in pens<br />
-Growth hormones/antibiotics are not used<br />
-Cows are hand-milked or at least personally supervised during machine-milking<br />
-Cows are not artificially inseminated<br />
-Cows are not sold to butchers who bleed them to death, skin them alive, etc.</p>
<p>I've probably missed things that I should have added, but I do hope this helps.</p>
<p>God Bless.</p>
